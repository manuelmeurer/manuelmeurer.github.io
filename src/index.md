# Hi there!

My name is Manuel Meurer and I am a web developer and entrepreneur based in Berlin, Germany. Since 2016, I have been working exclusively on **[Uplink](https://uplink.tech/)**, a network for IT freelancers in Germany.

I'm originally from Dortmund, where I studied IT with short stints in the USA and Sweden. After my studies I lived in Stockholm for a while before moving to Berlin in 2008. Here I worked as a freelance developer for many of the city's startups, agencies, and corporates.
